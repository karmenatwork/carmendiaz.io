        "Hola! Iâ€™m Carmen ðŸ‘‹, a proud Latina Software Developer based in the Bay Area, CA. Driven in agile environments, I have gained my full-stack expertise working in fast-paced start-ups accross Fintech, Health and Wellness, and HR.  I am actively pursuing courses to deepen my knowledge of AI and ML so that I can support my kid and his generation in facing tomorrow's (today) challenges.",
        "In my spare time, I enjoy immersing myself in workshops and seminars focused on personal development. I love traveling the world, exploring new places, taking pictures in my walks / hikings, and cooking healthy meals. I cherish quality time with my son doing fun activities like Lego building, hiking and playing soccer and basketball. When I have some me-time, I indulge in reading, playing piano and/or practicing kickboxing."

      "Computers and sports battled for my attention growing up. I would often skip my English classes to hit the tennis courts. My love for soccer saw me playing for both of my universities, and I even played field hokey for a couple of years!",
      "As the years went by, my curiosity grew stronger as I watched my oldest brother become increasingly immersed in technology. Before I knew it, I found myself eagerly waiting for him to leave for work or school, so I could secretly play on his computer.",
      "Starting my tech journey in Paraguay was quite the adventure, especially as a woman in a field where you could hardly find any ladies around. Picture this: a traditional Catholic family, my dad's a military engineer, my mom's a dentist, and my brothers are all about engineering, just like dad. Chances were NaN ðŸ˜…",
      "Sticking to traditional gender roles was the norm in my home, so me diving into Software Engineering was kind of a big deal. But I was captivated by technology and its potential, so I secretly chased my dream with the help of my super hero Ã‘ate (mi Mami), I studied for a business major at one university as my dad suggested, while surreptitiously studied a computer science-related career at another.",
      "Today, driven by a profound sense of responsibility to understand and navigate the increasingly AI-driven world my child is growing up in, I actively pursue courses to deepen my knowledge of AI and ML to support him and their generation in the challenges of tomorrow."
