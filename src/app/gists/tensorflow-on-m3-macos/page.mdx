As of early 2024, TensorFlow has **native support** for Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3 chips). This means you can run TensorFlow efficiently on your M3 Mac without needing to use Rosetta 2 for translation.

- **Installation is simpler now.** Apple has worked with the TensorFlow team to create a package called tensorflow-macos, which is optimized for Mac systems with Apple Silicon.

- **Metal support.** TensorFlow on Mac can use Apple's Metal framework for GPU acceleration, which is optimized for Apple Silicon.

## Before installation

- Make sure you have Xcode Command Line tools (Xcode CLT) installed by typing `xcode-select -p` in your terminal.

- Make sure you have a **pyenv** or **conda** for environment management.

I have followed [Conda's tip](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html): ***"If you are just starting out, we recommend installing Conda via the Miniconda installer."***
**Choose based on your** [experience.](https://docs.anaconda.com/distro-or-miniconda/).  

I just finished an AI/ML bootcamp so I'm still a ðŸ¥– bun in the oven ðŸ˜…. 

[Download the latest](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) Miniconda installer for macOS with Apple Silicon.
After the installation is finished, open your terminal and type the command  `conda`. You will see `(base)` in your terminal, which is the default environment. 

ðŸ”” Tip

It's a good idea to have jupyter installed there.  
`(base) âžœ  ~ conda install -y jupyter`

## Installation
### Option 1: Install packages one by one on a new environment


**1. Create and activate a virtual environment:** `conda create -n ENV_NAME`

**2. Upgrade pip:** `python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip`

**3. Install TensorFlow packages:**
`python3 -m pip install tensorflow-macos tensorflow-metal`

For example, you can create an environment with a python's version

`conda create -n ENV_NAME python=<version>` then activate it

such as: 

```
conda create -n tf python=3.11`
....
conda activate tf

(tf) python3 -m pip install tensorflow-macos
(tf) python3 -m pip install tensorflow-metal
```

### Option 2: Bundling packages on a `yml` file.

Put together a yml file similar to [tensorflow-m3-macos-env.yml](https://github.com/karmenatwork/tensorflow-on-m3-macos/blob/main/tensorflow-m3-macos-env.yml)

***Note:***
You do not need to install a specific package called `tensorflow-deps` for running TensorFlow on an M3 Mac as it used to be months ago. In my case, I decided to bundle the packages in a yml file, where I added jupyter notebook and some data science / machine learning packages I use often (pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn). Yet, trying to install tensorflow with `python 3.12`didn't work, so I downgraded to `python 3.11`

`conda env create --name tf -f tensorflow-m3-macos-env.yml` 

### Create environment

`conda create -n ENV_NAME`

For example, you can create an environment with a python's version

`conda create -n ENV_NAME python=<version>`

such as:  `conda create -n tf python=3.11`, and then to activate run

`conda activate tf`

You will see `(tf)`in your terminal, indicating that you are currently on that environment. 


You can test tensorflow quickly by importing it on a python environment in your terminal. 

```c
(tf) âžœ  tensorflow-on-m3-macos git:(main) âœ— python3
Python 3.11.9 | packaged by conda-forge | (main, Apr 19 2024, 18:34:54) [Clang 16.0.6 ] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import tensorflow as tf
>>> print(tf.__version__)
2.16.2
>>> 
```
