My old Macbook pro laptop\'s sound died right as I began my ML/AI bootcamp, reparing it would take a couple of weeks, so I took a leap and invested in an M3 MacBook. It's a game-changer, but setting it up for development is quiet an adventure. 

I\'ve been taking notes during the setup process, just in case I need to repeat these steps in the future ðŸ˜…. Here are my must have steps.



1. **Install Homebrew**

Homebrew is a free and open-source package manager that simplifies the installation of software on macOS and Linux.

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Once you have Homebrew installed, you could start installing the basics dev tools such as:


```shell
brew install \\
  git \\ - Version control
  nvm \\ - Node version manager
  pnpm \\ - Node package manager
  gh \\ - Github CLI
  wget \\ - cURL alternative

```
2. **iTerm2**

Download, unzip and move it to Application, or 

```
$ brew install --cask iterm2
````

3. **Customize ZSH shell**

 Since Catalina, the default shell in macOS has been `zsh` instead of the old default, `bash`. To customize `zsh`, I use the famous **Oh My ZSH!**

``` 
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
````

Open the file `.zshrc` and customize as you like. **Tip:** [ohmyzsh Cheatsheet](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Cheatsheet)

There are a couple of formulas worth to install from the go: 

```
brew install zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting
``` 

Add active these formulas add the following in your `.zshrc` file.
`
source $HOMEBREW_PREFIX/share/zsh-autocomplete/zsh-autocomplete.plugin.zsh
source $HOMEBREW_PREFIX/share/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh
`
